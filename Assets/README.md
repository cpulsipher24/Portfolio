## Description
This project is a responsive portfolio website designed to showcase my work samples. It provides an interactive and user-friendly experience for potential employers to review my portfolio.

## User Story
As an employer, I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria
To meet the needs of a typical hiring manager, the portfolio includes the following features:
- The developer's name and a recent photo or avatar are displayed.
- Links to sections about the developer, their work, and how to contact them are available.
- Clicking on navigation links scrolls the UI to the corresponding section.
- The "Work" section contains titled images of the developer's applications.
- The image of the first application is larger in size than the others.
- Clicking on application images redirects to the deployed application.
- The layout is responsive, adapting to various screens and devices.
